# selection-spinner

## Description

Throughout my current project my team has been using a spinner to decide who runs the daily standup. It got me wondering how I might be able to implement one myself - I haven't used vanilla CSS for a while so and thought it would be an interesting challenge! 

## Tools
- vanilla JS
- HTML/CSS
- esbuild
- jest
- make
- eslint

## Installation
``` code

git clone https://github.com/ellismckenzielee/selection-spinner.git

yarn install

right click index.html and open with Live Server in vscode

```

## Usage

To enter values in the selection spinner, add them as query params in the URL.For example:
``` code

?names=ellis,bob,jess

```
